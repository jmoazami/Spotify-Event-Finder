# Spotify-Event-Finder
This project, inspired by the work of Gracie Chiang, is meant to demonstrate my ability to extract personalized data from Spotify using the Spotify Developer API. Currently a work in progress, it will soon use this data and the TicketMaster API to find local concerts near you based off your favorite music.
